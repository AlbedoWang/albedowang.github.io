<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am currently an undergrad in USTC major in Information Security. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [USTC-NEBULA](https://www.nebuu.la) team, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed. Currently, I am honored to work with Professor [Yufei Dingâ€™s group](https://picassolab.squarespace.com) on ML systems, focusing on LLM server systems and DLRM. I am also collaborating with Professor [Weiming Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhangwm/#)(USTC) and Professor [Kejiang Chen](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~chenkj/).

Additionally, I am applying to CS PhD programs for Fall 2025 and am also looking for a 6-month industry internship in ML system (probably beginning in Mar.2025). Feel free to contact me!
