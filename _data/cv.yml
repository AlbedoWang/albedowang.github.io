    - title: Semantic Guidance for Diffusion Model
      year: 2024
      description: 
        - Conducted a detailed investigation into the semantic guidance of diffusion models, focusing on understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and experimental outcomes.
        - Identified existing issues within the semantic guidance provided by diffusion models, particularly emphasizing the loss of positional information.
        - Developed a straightforward method to address the loss of positional information in the semantic guidance of diffusion models, enhancing model accuracy and interpretability.
