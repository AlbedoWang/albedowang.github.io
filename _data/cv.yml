        - Robust Image Watermark 
        - Proposed a watermark recovery module based on image hiding, designed to restore information-embedded images subjected to cropping and spatial manipulation. 
        - Completed experiments on the reproduction of related research and developed the code for the module framework as proposed by coworker.

        - Review on Diffusion Model Watermarking
        - Learned the principles of diffusion model in depth, and explored works involved in embedding watermarks on images generated by diffusion models.
        - Tried to design a guiding map to use the probability distribution information in the diffusion process of the Diffusion Model to optimize subsequent watermark embedding.

    - title: Semantic Guidance for Diffusion Model
      year: 2024
      description: 
        - Conducted a detailed investigation into the semantic guidance of diffusion models, focusing on understanding both the theoretical underpinnings and experimental outcomes.
        - Identified existing issues within the semantic guidance provided by diffusion models, particularly emphasizing the loss of positional information.
        - Developed a straightforward method to address the loss of positional information in the semantic guidance of diffusion models, enhancing model accuracy and interpretability.
